I encountered a CORS error while working on the backend, which I believe could be resolved by installing the fruitcake/laravel-cors package, but I wasn't able to complete the fix.

To provide a functional demonstration of the front-end side, I duplicated and renamed App.tsx and PatientForm.tsx, creating an "only-front" version of the app that shows the React part of the challenge. The files AppWithBackend.tsx and PatientFormWithBackend.tsx contain the backend-connected code I was working on, though it remains incomplete due to the CORS issue.

I dedicated around 10–12 hours across Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, but with limited experience in Laravel and Docker, I spent significant time researching and troubleshooting those areas, which delayed my progress on the React side and required me to simplify it.

Although the challenge isn’t fully completed, I’m confident that with some additional training on Laravel and Docker, I could perform effectively.

I think it’s also worth mentioning that I hadn’t used React in nearly two years, but after a few moments of ‘Wait, how did this work again?’ I quickly felt comfortable with it. React is a technology I really enjoy working with.
